##	Design

###	    Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are the shades of blue – namely light blue, rgba(137, 196, 244), #00008b and blue – and #fff9e3, a shade of ivory. 
        This colours are chosen as they closely resemble the colours worn by the Mother of the Catholic Church.
        
###	    Typography
        -   The Style Script font is the main font used for the header, headings 1 and 2 with Verdana as the fallback font in case for any reason the font is not being imported correctly into the site. 
        Style Script is a nice cursive form, being cursive it depicts olden calligraphy style for Churches.
        -   For the rest of the body text, Poppins font is used with Sans Serif as the fallback font. 
        Poppins is clean and legible and compliments Style Script very well.

###	    Imagery
        -   Imagery is important and captures a user’s attention. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and depicts what the page is all about. 
        The image used is a highlight of the activities done by a choir, which depicts being a proud and active member of the church.

## Bugs
Solved Bugs
- When I was positioning the main image it was not responding to the code given, hence I have to specify by attribute to get the size and position needed. 
I used this site to help me fix the problem, https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/pr_background-position.asp.
- When aligning to center the requirements of becoming a choir member in the second page, for the media query, it was not responding to the code. 
I tried to search online but it wasn’t clear, so I asked for tutor support. 
And he said that it could probably be due to different overriding codes and the float that I placed. 
He discussed the solution and was able to fix the problem.
- When I deployed my project to GitHub and used the responsiveness site http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#, I discovered that in one of the images (laptop), my hero image and tagline was not responding well/distorted. Since I was using the laptop, I asked tutor support on how to do this, and they responded to my inquiry. Only then that I realize that the response of the site does not depend on a fixed value but on when the site gets broken when the screen size changes. Hence, I did some trials and was able to come up with the value for the screen. I also received help from Slack http://slack.com community to check and fix my code.

## Deployment
•	The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
1.  Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
2.  In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
3.  Scroll down to search for the Section that says GitHub pages.
4.  A message written there saying that GitHub pages has its own dedicated tab and will tell you to click the link.
5.  From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch and click save.
6.  Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a check beside the link to indicate the successful deployment.
